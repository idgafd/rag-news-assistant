You are an expert assistant helping to build a high-quality retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on news articles from the website https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/.

Below is the full text of one such article.

Your task is to simulate realistic user behavior by generating two sets of search queries:

1. **Relevant Queries**: Write 10 realistic, diverse, and high-quality search queries that a user might type into a search bar if they are trying to find this specific article. These queries should:
   - reflect the core topics, ideas, or events discussed in the article,
   - vary in phrasing, tone, or user intent (e.g., some might be questions, others might be keywords),
   - use everyday language that real users would naturally type.

2. **Non-Relevant or Partially Relevant Queries**: Write 10 queries that could plausibly return this article by accident due to overlapping terms or surface-level similarity, but are actually **not truly relevant** to the article's content. These could:
   - use vague or overly broad phrasing,
   - focus on side mentions that are not the article's main topic,
   - represent misunderstandings or incorrect associations with the content.

Return your result strictly in valid JSON format, like this:

{
  "relevant": [
    "query 1",
    "query 2",
    ...
  ],
  "non_relevant": [
    "query A",
    "query B",
    ...
  ]
}

Here is the article:
